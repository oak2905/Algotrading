##### (1) intraday_cash_future_arbitrage.ipynb - Implemented a cash future arbitrage system which generates buy/sell signals in live real time environment using Fyers websocket API to input the data. Furthur explanation in the notebook.
##### (2) options_putcallparity_arbitrage.ipynb - Implemented an options put call parity arbitrage system which generates buy/sell signals in live real time environment using Fyers websocket API to input the data. Furthur explanation in the notebook.
##### (3) lstm_3white_soldiers.ipynb - Designed and implemented the LSTM algorithm to predict 3 white soldiers pattern based on a lookback period of 3. While training the data, the signal is taken as 1 if the previous 3 candlesticks are 3 white soldiers and the next 40 candlesticks are above the stop loss.
##### (4) supportline_detector.ipynb - Designed an algorithm to detect the support line in a live real time environment using 1 minute data from Fyers History API.
